Session: 2024-02-17
Prompt: "please start docker compose and run the helper python scripts, fix any errors"
Actions taken:
1. Started Docker containers using docker compose
2. Installed Python dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Set up Python environment and PYTHONPATH
4. Ran api_client_demo.py and sample_usage.py successfully
5. Verified API endpoints are accessible and functioning

Status: Complete - All services running and basic functionality verified
Notes: Expected 404/500 errors observed due to no existing modules, which is normal behavior

Session: 2024-02-17
Prompt: "please help me create some test modules"
Actions taken:
1. Created AWS VPC module in module_storage/test/aws-vpc with:
   - main.tf: VPC and subnet resources
   - variables.tf: Input variables for CIDR, names, and configuration
   - outputs.tf: VPC ID, ARN, and subnet IDs
   - README.md: Module documentation and usage examples

2. Created Azure Storage module in module_storage/test/azure-storage with:
   - main.tf: Storage account and container resources
   - variables.tf: Input variables for names, tiers, and configuration
   - outputs.tf: Storage account IDs and access keys
   - README.md: Module documentation and usage examples

Status: Complete - Created two example modules ready for testing

[2024-03-20] Action: Fixed ModuleNotFoundError
- Issue: Missing aiohttp module
- Action taken: Installed aiohttp package using pip
- Result: Successfully installed aiohttp and its dependencies

[2024-03-20] Action: Fixed Docker Container aiohttp Error
- Issue: Backend container failing due to missing aiohttp module
- Action taken: Rebuilt Docker container to include updated requirements.txt with aiohttp
- Result: Backend service started successfully with no errors

[2024-03-20] Action: Relaxed Module Validation Requirements
- Issue: Module validation was too strict requiring main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, and README.md
- Action taken: Modified ModuleValidator class to treat these files as recommended rather than required
- Result: Module validation now provides warnings instead of errors for missing recommended files

Transaction Log:

2024-01-17:
Prompt: "running terraform validate should be all the validation thats required. It wont be able to operate on a zip file, we'll need to extract it first."
Actions:
1. Initial modification to add terraform validation before module upload
   - Added validate_terraform_module() function that runs 'terraform init' and 'terraform validate'
   - Updated main() to validate modules before creating zip and uploading
   - Added validation failure handling to skip invalid modules

2. Enhanced validation to check zip contents
   - Added validate_and_upload_module() function to extract and validate zip contents
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Restructured code to validate the actual zip that will be uploaded

3. Moved validation to server-side (validation.py)
   - Added terraform validation to ModuleValidator class
   - Created validate_terraform_module() method that runs init and validate
   - Updated validate_module_structure() to extract and validate zip contents
   - Added proper error handling and logging for terraform validation

2024-01-17:
Prompt: "we need to make sure to clean up the temporary directory that the ModuleValidator uses to unpack and run terraform commands, otherwise eventually we'll run out of disk space."
Actions:
- Enhanced temporary directory cleanup in ModuleValidator
  - Initially switched to explicit cleanup with shutil.rmtree
  - Then improved by using Python's TemporaryDirectory context manager
  - Added debug logging for directory lifecycle
  - Removed manual cleanup code in favor of automatic context manager cleanup
  - Added logging to verify cleanup is occurring

2024-01-17:
Prompt: "I believe the error is in the backend code, the validation in validation.py is no quite right. We should only be validating on terraform validate and that at least one .tf file exists."
Actions:
- Simplified ModuleValidator class in validation.py
  - Removed all file recommendations (main.tf, variables.tf, etc.)
  - Added requirement for at least one .tf file
  - Kept terraform init and validate as core validation
  - Streamlined error handling to focus on essential validations
  - Removed warnings system since we only care about hard requirements now

2024-01-17:
Prompt: "why do we have multiple validate_module_structure functions defined in our codebase?"
Actions:
- Identified duplicate validation code between app/validation.py and app/validation/validation.py
- Deprecated app/validation/validation.py with warning message
- Consolidated validation logic to single implementation in app/validation.py
- Added imports in deprecated file for backwards compatibility
